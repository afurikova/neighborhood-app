/*Note that some CSS that works within quirks mode is not valid 
in standards mode. In specific, all percentage-based sizes must 
inherit from parent block elements, and if any of those ancestors 
fail to specify a size, they are assumed to be sized at 0 x 0 pixels. 
For that reason, we include the following <style> declaration:*/

html { 
	height: 100% 
}
body { 
	height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0 
}
#map-canvas { 
	height: 100% 
}
